# Derf Simple Game Engine

This is a little game engine project that I'm creating to help me develop small game projects
for myself. You are free to use said engine. The main focus for now is to be a very simple 2D
game engine that add in basic functionality like 2D spriting, 2D tilemaps, and other stuff. 

For now the main language that will be used to develop game will be c++, however, I'm thinking of
intergrating lua as the primary scripting language down the road. For now I'm going to grab all
3rd party libraries I want for the project which I'll make a list of them.
